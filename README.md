# U-Tad 

Projects and content carried out during my B.S. Double Degree in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at U-Tad.

The repository is organized by academic year, semester, and finally by subject, where I have stored practical materials from the subjects, personal projects, and exams. Some subjects like mathematics only have a markdown transcription of the syllabus and not full examples, unlike programming-related subjects.
