# U-Tad 

Projects and content carried out during my B.S. Double Degree in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at U-Tad. This program at U-Tad offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary education that combines the core principles of **Computer Science** with advanced mathematical theories, preparing students to tackle complex problems in areas such as data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering. The curriculum is designed to provide both practical and theoretical knowledge, equipping students with the necessary skills to develop innovative technologies and solutions.

The repository is organized by academic year, semester, and finally by subject, where I have stored the main study content, practical materials from the subjects, personal projects, and exams. Many of the subjects, such as those taken in the mathematics section of the double degree, do not include practical or coding content, so they will only contain a transcription of my summaries and study materials into Markdown. The rest of the subjects, unless otherwise specified, will have the full content (study material, examples, practical exercises, etc.).

# Degree Curriculum:
The degree is divided into **five academic years**, each consisting of two semesters (Q1 & Q2), which offer a blend of **core subjects**, **elective subjects**, and **project work**. Throughout the degree, students explore a variety of subjects related to both disciplines, giving them a well-rounded understanding of both the technical and mathematical aspects of computing.

## 1st Course:
In the **first year**, we are introduced to the fundamental concepts of programming, web development, operating systems, and networking, along with the foundational mathematical concepts such as **Algebra** and **Discrete Mathematics**. This is the period where students build their base knowledge and start developing problem-solving skills. The first-year projects focus on digital technologies and basic software development practices, with a year final project of robotics.

In the **second year** we acquire programming skills in algorithms, POO, data structures, and design patterns. We are introduced to the subjects of computer networks and operating systems as a continuation and extension of first-year subjects (network lab and computer architecture). For the mathematics part, we are presented with some of the main branches of mathematics (like **Probability**, **Statistics**, and **Calculus**) and their practical applications in software. With the final project, students are presented and must choose between the two main mentions of the degree, cybersecurity and big data.
