# **Startup: Homestead Energies**

I have envisioned Homestead Energies as a fictional startup dedicated to the development and distribution of floating wind turbines inspired by technologies like BAT (Buoyant Airborne Turbine). Its main goal is to offer sustainable energy solutions to rural and hard-to-reach communities where conventional power grids are unavailable or unreliable. The company has an online presence through a website that provides information about its products, accepts orders, and shares real-life stories of customers who have transformed their quality of life thanks to this technology.

**Name:** Homestead Energies  
**Industry:** Renewable Energy / Sustainable Technology / Ecommerce (B2B and B2C)  
**Product:** Floating wind turbines (BAT - Buoyant Airborne Turbines) for rural and hard-to-reach areas.  
**Online Presence:** Informative and commercial website, digital catalog, online store for direct purchases or commercial inquiries, maintenance and monitoring app.

## **Segmentation and Target Audience**

To design an effective strategy, we segmented the market based on the following criteria:

- **Geographic:** We focus on rural areas in Latin America and southern Europe, where access to energy remains a challenge. Islands and isolated communities are also considered.  
- **Demographic:** People aged 30 to 60, community leaders, farmers, rural cooperatives, or small business owners who need energy for their operations.  
- **Psychographic:** Environmentally conscious individuals interested in self-sustainable solutions and eager to improve their quality of life and that of their community.  
- **Behavioral:** Users who have shown interest in renewable energy, sustainable technology, and who often seek practical solutions to structural problems.

### **Buyer Example 1**

**Name:** Ana Rivas  
**Age:** 38 years  
**Location:** Rural community in Oaxaca, Mexico  
**Occupation:** Coordinator of an agricultural cooperative  
**Goals:** Ensure stable and clean energy for irrigation and refrigeration systems.  
**Challenges:** High fuel costs for generators, frequent power outages, environmental damage.  
**Digital Behavior:** Uses social media to learn about green technologies, communicates via WhatsApp and email, browses websites on her phone.  
**Purchase Decision:** Gathers information on social media, asks other users, reviews terms and warranties, seeks nearby technical support.

**Targeting:**  
The most attractive segment for Homestead Energies is **rural cooperatives and NGOs** working on sustainable electrification. A B2B2C approach will be prioritized to achieve greater short-term impact and establish strategic alliances.

### **Buyer Example 2**

**Name:** Don Javier  
**Age:** 48 years  
**Location:** Rural community in Salamanca  
**Occupation:** Farmer and member of the community council  
**Needs:** Requires constant energy to operate a small irrigation system, light his home, and charge devices.  
**Challenges:** Limited access to energy, reliance on gasoline generators, which are expensive and polluting.  
**Behavior:** Reads blogs about rural technology, listens to sustainability podcasts, participates in online community forums.

**Targeting:**  
Our primary segment will be organized rural communities or associations seeking self-sufficient energy solutions. They are prioritized because they urgently need to solve a structural problem and often have government or NGO support to implement these solutions.
