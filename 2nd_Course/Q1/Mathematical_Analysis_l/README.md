## **Course Overview**

The objective of this course is for students to develop the ability to understand and construct rigorous mathematical proofs, while gaining a solid understanding and command of the fundamental concepts and techniques of differential and integral calculus. Once students are confident in single-variable calculus, the course prepares them for generalization to multivariable contexts and the study of complex-valued functions.

Mathematical Analysis I aims to reinforce students' comprehension of basic concepts in differential and integral calculus from both theoretical and computational perspectives. It also introduces more advanced topics such as improper, Eulerian, and parametric integrals, as well as sequences and series of functions. The course lays the groundwork for understanding Fourier series and transforms, which are essential for more advanced courses in the program.
