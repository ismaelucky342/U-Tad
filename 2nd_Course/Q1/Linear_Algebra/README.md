## **Course Overview**

This course is dedicated to the study of vector spaces and linear transformations, groups, rings, and fields, including an introduction to Galois Theory.

Linear algebra is an essential tool for almost all branches of mathematics, as well as for engineering and computer science. This subject works from the algebraic structure of the vector space and the handling of matrices and linear transformations to develop the management of endomorphisms and study properties of affine and Euclidean spaces. An analysis of vector geometry is carried out using algebraic instruments. Its application to coding is also studied.
