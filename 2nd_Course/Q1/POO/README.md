### **Course Overview**

This course focuses on the study of object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and languages. It is fundamental for software engineering students as it introduces the essential knowledge required to design and implement programs using object-oriented principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, in a programming language that supports OOP.

The course includes both theoretical learning and practical exercises, providing students with the tools needed to develop software in a modular and reusable way, by structuring the code around objects and classes.

### **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and manage the concept of dynamic memory in programming.
- Identify and define classes and objects that represent the data of a given problem.
- Create and manipulate classes and objects.
- Apply inheritance, polymorphism, and operator overloading mechanisms in OOP.
- Identify relationships between classes in various use cases.
- Master an object-oriented programming language (Java).
- Understand and apply programming patterns.
- Recognize and implement algorithms to solve problems, such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking, or genetic algorithms.
- Analyze the complexity of algorithms and optimize them if necessary.
- Implement programs capable of finding the optimal path between nodes in a graph using pathfinding algorithms.
- Create and train neural networks to solve specific problems.
