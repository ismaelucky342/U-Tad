# POO Final Exam: Exercise 1

Define an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `calculateArea()`. Then, create the 

subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle`, implementing the method as appropriate (`Rectangle`: base * height, `Circle`: π * r²). 

Finally, write a `main` method that receives a list of shapes and calculates the sum of their areas.
