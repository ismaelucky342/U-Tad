# Unit 4: Memory II

## **Overview**

This unit builds upon the concepts of memory from Unit 3 and delves deeper into real memory and virtual memory management. We'll explore Memory Management Units (MMUs), memory allocation techniques, and the mechanisms behind virtual memory, including tables, TLBs, and page replacement algorithms. Additionally, exercises are provided to reinforce understanding of these complex concepts. By the end of this unit, you will have a comprehensive understanding of memory management, both in real and virtual contexts.

## **Real Memory**

### **Introduction**

Real memory, or physical memory, refers to the actual hardware memory present in a computer system. Efficient management of this memory is essential for system stability and performance.

### **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**

- The MMU translates virtual addresses into physical addresses, enabling the OS to manage memory efficiently.

### **Memory Allocation Techniques**

- **Contiguous Allocation**: Memory is allocated in contiguous blocks.
- **Non-Contiguous Allocation**: Memory is divided into non-contiguous blocks (e.g., linked lists, bitmaps).

### **Real Memory Allocation Algorithms**

- **First Fit**, **Best Fit**, **Worst Fit**: Common algorithms for managing memory allocation in systems.

### **Segmentation**

- Segmentation divides memory into segments based on the logical structure of a program, such as functions or data arrays.

## **Virtual Memory**

### **Introduction**

Virtual memory extends the physical memory by providing an abstraction layer that allows programs to use more memory than is physically available.

### **Virtual Memory Operation**

- Virtual memory operates by mapping logical addresses to physical addresses using techniques such as paging and segmentation.

### **One-Level Table Model**

- Simplified representation of how virtual addresses are mapped to physical addresses through a single table.

### **Non-Simplified Version**

- A more complex approach involves multi-level page tables for mapping virtual addresses to physical memory.

### **Address Translation**

- Virtual addresses are translated into physical addresses using page tables. The process includes determining the frame corresponding to the virtual page.

### **Multi-Level Tables**

- For large address spaces, multi-level tables are used to efficiently manage address translation.

### **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**

- TLB caches recently accessed page table entries to speed up translation of virtual addresses to physical addresses.

### **TLB with Cache**

- TLB is often combined with cache memory to enhance performance by reducing translation time.

### **Page Fault**

- A page fault occurs when a requested page is not in memory, requiring retrieval from storage (e.g., swap space).

### **Page Replacement Algorithm**

- Common algorithms include FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), and Optimal Replacement.

### **Swap Area Management**

- Swap space is used when physical memory is exhausted, helping manage processes by swapping pages to and from disk storage.

## **Memory Image Management**

### **Introduction**

Managing the memory image is essential for system stability, allowing efficient memory allocation, use, and release.

### **Memory Management in Linux**

- Linux manages memory through various kernel subsystems, handling processes and user memory efficiently.

### **Memory Management in XV6**

- The educational operating system XV6 utilizes basic memory management techniques for demonstration purposes.
