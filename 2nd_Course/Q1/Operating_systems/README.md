### **Course Overview**

The *Operating Systems* course covers the essential principles and practices behind the core functions of an operating system, using both Linux and the educational xv6 operating system as practical tools for students to gain firsthand experience in how a kernel operates, manages processes and memory, and handles file systems. The course introduces system programming and reinforces theoretical concepts through the development of two software projects.

### **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the architecture of operating systems and how they manage system resources.
- Understand the mechanisms for process management, communication, and synchronization within an OS.
- Develop basic system software such as file systems and device drivers.
- Implement synchronization mechanisms between processes and threads.
- Understand memory management strategies and techniques.
- Understand and apply the basic principles of I/O management.
- Develop simple network applications and manage basic networking configurations.
- Learn to debug software and manage software versions with tools such as Git.
- Develop system software using languages like C and assembly.
