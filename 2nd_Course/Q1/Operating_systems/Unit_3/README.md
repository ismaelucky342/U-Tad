# Unit 3: Memory I

## **Overview**

This unit covers the fundamentals of memory in computer systems, focusing on cache memory and its impact on system performance. We'll explore the principles of memory hierarchy, the principle of locality, and various mechanisms for correspondence between entries and blocks in cache. Additionally, modern cache-level mechanisms, replacement policies, and write policies in contemporary processors will be discussed. By the end of this unit, you will have a solid understanding of how memory operates in modern systems.

## **Memory**

### **Introduction**

This section introduces the basic concepts of memory and its significance in computing systems.

### **Memory Hierarchy**

- Memory systems are structured in a hierarchy to balance cost, speed, and capacity.
- Higher levels of memory (e.g., cache) offer faster access times, while lower levels (e.g., disk) provide greater capacity.

### **Principle of Locality**

- The principle of locality refers to the tendency of programs to access a relatively small portion of their address space at any given time.
- Locality can be temporal (recently accessed data) or spatial (adjacent data in memory).

### **Memory Hierarchy Scheme and Word Concept**

- Memory is organized in a hierarchy of levels, where each level serves a different purpose—registers, cache, RAM, and disk.
- The concept of a word relates to the smallest unit of data that a processor can operate on.

## **Cache Memory**

### **Introduction**

Cache memory serves as a high-speed storage layer between the processor and main memory, reducing access latency.

### **Cache Access Time vs RAM Access Time**

- Cache memory offers significantly faster access times compared to main RAM, improving system performance.

## **Correspondence Mechanisms Between Entries and Blocks**

### **Introduction**

Various mechanisms determine how data is mapped between memory entries and cache blocks.

### **Direct Mapping Method**

- Direct mapping maps memory blocks to cache lines in a fixed and predictable manner.

### **Associative Mapping Method**

- In associative mapping, a block can be mapped to any cache line, offering flexibility in data retrieval.

### **Set-Associative Mapping Method**

- Set-associative mapping divides cache into sets, where each set contains a specific number of cache lines, allowing more flexibility and improved hit rates.

## **Cache Memory in Modern Processors**

### **Introduction**

Modern processors incorporate multiple levels of cache to optimize performance.

### **Multi-Level Cache**

- Processors utilize multiple levels of cache—L1, L2, L3—to balance speed and storage.

### **Replacement Policies**

- Replacement policies determine how cache lines are replaced when new data needs to be loaded.
    - Examples include Least Recently Used (LRU), First-In-First-Out (FIFO), etc.

### **Write Policies**

- Write policies dictate how write operations are handled in cache, including write-through and write-back methods.
