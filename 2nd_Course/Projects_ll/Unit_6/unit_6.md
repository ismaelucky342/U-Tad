# UNIT 6: Cybersecurity Audits

## **Introduction**

Cybersecurity audits are comprehensive evaluations of an organization’s information systems, networks, and procedures to assess the effectiveness of its security controls. These audits identify vulnerabilities, ensure compliance with relevant standards and regulations, and help organizations improve their overall security posture. The goal is not only to uncover existing weaknesses but also to provide actionable insights to mitigate future risks.

The audit process typically includes the review of policies, system configurations, access controls, data protection methods, and incident response capabilities. Below are three critical areas covered during a cybersecurity audit: **Perimeter Systems**, **Network Infrastructure**, and **Physical Security**.

## **Perimeter Systems Audit**

A perimeter systems audit focuses on the outermost boundaries of an organization’s IT infrastructure—the first line of defense against external threats. It involves evaluating firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), web application firewalls (WAF), and demilitarized zones (DMZ).

Key elements reviewed:

- Firewall rules and configuration
- Remote access policies (VPN, SSH)
- Port scanning and vulnerability assessment
- External IP exposure and DNS configurations
- Web server security and patch levels

The goal is to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed and that the perimeter devices are properly configured and updated to prevent intrusion attempts.

---

## **Network Audit**

A network audit examines the internal architecture and flow of data across the organization’s systems. This includes routers, switches, wireless access points, and the segmentation of internal networks.

Key elements reviewed:

- Network topology and segmentation
- Access control lists (ACLs) and VLANs
- Secure configurations of network devices
- Monitoring and logging mechanisms
- Detection of rogue devices or anomalous traffic

By identifying misconfigurations or gaps in internal security, the audit helps to prevent lateral movement in case of a breach and strengthens overall network resilience.

---

## **Physical Audit**

While digital threats are a major concern, physical security remains a foundational component of cybersecurity. A physical audit evaluates how well an organization protects its hardware, facilities, and sensitive information from unauthorized physical access.

Key elements reviewed:

- Access controls (badges, biometrics, locks)
- Surveillance systems (CCTV, motion sensors)
- Environmental controls (temperature, humidity, fire suppression)
- Security of server rooms and data centers
- Visitor logs and physical asset inventory

Physical audits help ensure that sensitive systems and data are safeguarded against theft, tampering, and damage due to environmental factors or unauthorized entry.

# **Phases of a Cybersecurity Audit**

## **Introduction**

A cybersecurity audit is a structured process composed of multiple phases designed to assess, test, and enhance an organization’s security posture. Each phase builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of the environment, its weaknesses, and how to address them effectively. Below are the standard phases of a cybersecurity audit:

---

## **1. Information Gathering**

This initial phase involves collecting all relevant data about the target organization, both publicly available and internally accessible (with permission). The goal is to understand the environment, identify potential entry points, and prepare for more targeted assessments.

Typical activities:

- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
- Review of network diagrams and documentation
- Identification of external IP addresses, domains, and subdomains
- Social engineering and phishing simulations (if in scope)

---

## **2. Asset Enumeration**

In this phase, auditors systematically identify and map out all devices, systems, applications, and services connected to the organization’s network. This helps establish a full inventory of what needs to be protected and audited.

Typical activities:

- Network scanning and host discovery
- Service and port enumeration
- Identifying operating systems and software versions
- Detection of shadow IT or undocumented systems

---

## **3. Vulnerability Analysis**

Once assets have been identified, they are assessed for known vulnerabilities. This phase focuses on discovering weaknesses in system configurations, outdated software, exposed services, or poor security practices.

Typical activities:

- Use of automated vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS)
- Manual verification of findings
- Configuration and patch level analysis
- Assessment of weak passwords and misconfigured services

---

## **4. Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**

With the discovered vulnerabilities, ethical hackers or auditors attempt to exploit them (with proper authorization) to demonstrate potential real-world impacts. The objective is not to cause harm, but to validate the severity of the vulnerabilities.

Typical activities:

- Exploitation using penetration testing tools (e.g., Metasploit)
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Gaining unauthorized access to systems or data
- Demonstrating impact without causing operational disruption

---

## **5. Post-Exploitation**

After successful exploitation, this phase assesses what an attacker could do next. It simulates how far an attacker could pivot inside the network, access sensitive data, or maintain persistence.

Typical activities:

- Lateral movement analysis
- Data exfiltration scenarios
- Creation of backdoors or persistence mechanisms
- Cleanup to ensure no residual changes remain

---

## **6. Documentation**

The final and critical phase involves compiling all findings, evidence, and recommendations into a clear and actionable report. This documentation supports remediation efforts and helps the organization enhance its defenses.

Typical components:

- Executive summary and technical details
- List of vulnerabilities with severity ratings
- Proof of concept (PoC) for critical findings
- Recommendations for remediation and future improvements

# **Vulnerability Analysis in a Web Audit**

## **Introduction**

Vulnerability analysis in a web audit is a key phase where the security posture of a web application is rigorously assessed. The goal is to identify flaws that could be exploited by attackers, ranging from misconfigurations and outdated components to critical application-layer vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

This analysis allows security teams to understand how an attacker might interact with the application and to recommend effective remediation strategies. Below are the main steps typically followed in this process.

---

## **1. Identification of Technologies**

Before analyzing vulnerabilities, it's essential to understand the technological stack behind the application. Knowing what technologies are used helps narrow down the scope of potential weaknesses.

### Key activities:

- Identifying the server-side language (e.g., PHP, ASP.NET, Node.js)
- Recognizing frameworks (e.g., Laravel, Django, React)
- Determining the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, IIS)
- Detecting CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Joomla)
- Identifying third-party libraries and plugins

### Tools:

- Wappalyzer
- BuiltWith
- HTTP headers analysis
- Manual inspection of page source
