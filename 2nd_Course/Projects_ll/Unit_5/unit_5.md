## **Current Context**

With the increase in data breaches, phishing campaigns, and sophisticated attacks, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Organizations are legally and ethically required to protect user data and ensure the integrity of their digital platforms.

Modern web applications are complex, often built using multiple frameworks, libraries, and third-party services. This complexity introduces new vulnerabilities and increases the attack surface, making continuous auditing a necessity rather than a luxury.

---

## **What is Web Auditing?**

Web auditing is a process aimed at identifying security flaws in web applications. It involves a thorough assessment of the application’s components, configurations, and data handling to detect vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, insecure authentication mechanisms, or sensitive data exposure.

Web audits can be manual, automated, or a combination of both, and are essential for:

- Compliance with standards like ISO 27001, GDPR, and PCI DSS.
- Improving user trust and application integrity.
- Proactively identifying and fixing weaknesses before they are exploited.

---

## **Perimeter Audits**

Perimeter audits focus on the external interfaces of a web application—the parts exposed to the internet. This includes web servers, firewalls, and any publicly accessible endpoints.

### Main goals of a perimeter audit:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of access controls and filtering rules.
- Detect open ports, exposed services, and misconfigurations.
- Identify unprotected entry points and attack vectors.

Perimeter auditing helps ensure that only necessary and secure communication channels are available to external users, significantly reducing the risk of compromise.

# **HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol**

## **Introduction**

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is a request-response protocol used for transferring web pages, images, and other resources between clients (typically web browsers) and servers. Understanding HTTP is essential for web development, security auditing, and troubleshooting web applications.

In this section, we will dive into the HTTP communication model, requests and responses, common HTTP methods, proxy servers, and cookies.

---

## **HTTP Communication Model**

HTTP operates on a client-server model where the client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested resource or an error message. This communication occurs over the TCP/IP protocol.

### Key Components:

- **Client**: The requester of resources (e.g., web browsers or mobile apps).
- **Server**: The provider of resources (e.g., a web server hosting a website).
- **Request**: A message sent by the client asking for a resource.
- **Response**: A message sent by the server containing the requested resource or status information.

Each interaction consists of a **request** made by the client and a **response** provided by the server. The communication is stateless, meaning each request is independent and does not retain information about previous requests unless handled through mechanisms like cookies or sessions.

---

## **HTTP Requests**

An HTTP request is initiated by the client to ask the server for a resource, such as an HTML page, an image, or data from an API.

### Request Structure:

1. **Request Line**: Contains the HTTP method, the resource URL, and the HTTP version.
    - Example: `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
2. **Headers**: Provide additional information about the request (e.g., user agent, accepted content types).
    - Example: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0`
3. **Body** (Optional): Carries data that may need to be sent to the server, such as form submissions.
    - Example: A POST request body containing user login credentials.

### Common HTTP Request Methods:

- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server (e.g., a web page).
- **POST**: Sends data to the server, often used for submitting forms or data.
- **PUT**: Sends data to the server to create or update a resource.
- **DELETE**: Deletes a specified resource from the server.
- **HEAD**: Similar to GET, but only retrieves the headers, not the body.
- **PATCH**: Partially updates a resource on the server.

---

## **HTTP Responses**

An HTTP response is the server's reply to an HTTP request. It contains a status code indicating whether the request was successful, and may also include the requested resource or error messages.

### Response Structure:

1. **Status Line**: Includes the HTTP version, a status code, and a reason phrase.
    - Example: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
2. **Headers**: Provide metadata about the response (e.g., content type, server information).
    - Example: `Content-Type: text/html`
3. **Body**: Contains the actual content requested (e.g., HTML, JSON, images).
    - Example: The HTML code of a webpage.

### Common HTTP Response Status Codes:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server is returning the requested resource.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an error processing the request.

---

## **HTTP Methods**

HTTP defines several methods to indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource. These methods are used in the request to communicate the action needed.

### Key HTTP Methods:

- **GET**: Retrieve a resource without modifying it.
- **POST**: Submit data to be processed by the server (e.g., submitting a form).
- **PUT**: Replace a resource or create it if it doesn't exist.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.
- **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource.
- **OPTIONS**: Retrieve the supported methods for a specific resource or server.
- **HEAD**: Similar to GET but only returns headers without a body.

---

## **HTTP Proxy**

An HTTP proxy is an intermediary server between a client and a server that intercepts and relays HTTP requests and responses. It is often used to improve performance, enhance security, and provide anonymity.

### Key Uses of HTTP Proxies:

- **Caching**: Proxies can store copies of frequently requested resources to reduce server load and speed up response times.
- **Anonymity**: By routing requests through a proxy, clients can mask their IP addresses, enhancing privacy.
- **Content Filtering**: Proxies can be used to filter requests, blocking access to certain websites or content.
- **Access Control**: Proxies can enforce policies by restricting access to specific resources based on IP, time, or user credentials.

---

## **Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of data stored by the browser on the client-side, used to maintain stateful information between requests. They are essential for user authentication, session management, and tracking.

### Common Uses of Cookies:

- **Session Management**: Cookies store session identifiers to track users across multiple requests (e.g., after logging into a website).
- **Personalization**: Storing user preferences or settings between visits.
- **Tracking**: Used for analytics and advertising to track user behavior on websites.

### Cookie Structure:

- **Name**: The identifier for the cookie.
- **Value**: The data associated with the cookie.
- **Domain**: The domain for which the cookie is valid.
- **Path**: The specific URL path for which the cookie is valid.
- **Expiration Date**: The date when the cookie will expire and be deleted.
- **Secure**: Indicates if the cookie should only be sent over HTTPS.

# **Web Technologies**

## **Introduction**

Web technologies are the backbone of the modern internet. They enable the development of websites and web applications, allowing users to interact with data and services across the world. In this section, we will explore some of the most widely used technologies in web development, including HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. Understanding these technologies is essential for anyone looking to build dynamic, interactive, and data-driven web applications.
