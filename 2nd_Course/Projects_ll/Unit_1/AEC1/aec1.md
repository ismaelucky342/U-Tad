# AEC3: Our Future and Its Relationship with Data  

As technology continues to evolve rapidly, especially in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, and immersive environments, new professions are emerging that will be crucial in shaping a fair, empathetic, and sustainable future. Below are some of the future job roles that I believe will be essential, along with reflections on how technology might influence medicine, privacy, environmental conservation, and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outlined in the 2030 Agenda.

**AI Ethics Supervisor**

I believe one of the most important future roles will be that of an *AI Ethics Supervisor*, responsible for ensuring that AI systems respect human values and principles. These supervisors will monitor the decisions made by AI, evaluating whether they reflect biases related to gender, race, or other forms of discrimination.

This job will also involve collaborating with lawmakers and international organizations to establish clear ethical guidelines for AI. For example, they must ensure that facial recognition systems are not used in discriminatory ways or that decision-making algorithms do not unfairly favor certain groups.

**AI Psychology Specialist**

This role has a unique focus: teaching AI systems to understand and respond to human emotions. As interactions with virtual assistants and robots become more common, the emotional experience of users will become increasingly important.

The AI psychology specialist will be in charge of designing algorithms that allow machines to correctly interpret human emotions and respond with empathy and appropriateness.

**Virtual and Augmented Reality Architect**

In this role, the architect will not only create virtual worlds but also design immersive environments tailored to each user, using AI to adapt the experiences based on individual preferences and needs.

In education, for example, students could immerse themselves in interactive virtual lessons that adapt to their learning pace.

**Algorithmic Transparency Auditor**

As algorithms take on increasingly critical decision-making roles, the need for auditors who ensure fairness and transparency will become essential. The algorithmic transparency auditor will analyze and certify that algorithms are free of hidden biases and that their decision-making processes are clear.

This role will require strong technical knowledge but also a deep commitment to social justice, ensuring that automated decisions do not perpetuate inequalities.

**Human-Robot Interaction Engineer**

Lastly, I envision a role that will soon become essential: the *Human-Robot Interaction Engineer*. As robots become more integrated into our daily and professional lives, this engineer will design robots that can interact naturally and efficiently with humans.

These professionals will work on both the physical design of robots and their behavior and responsiveness, ensuring that interactions are smooth and beneficial.

**What role do you think Big Data will play in medical decision-making at the social and political level in the future?**

Big Data will play a key role in personalized medicine and public health policy management. By collecting and analyzing large volumes of data, governments and medical entities will be able to identify disease patterns, predict outbreaks, and develop personalized treatments. For instance, regarding one of this century's major challenges—bacterial microresistance—AI integration could predict which medications are no longer effective for a patient based on their medical history, ensuring the correct treatment is administered in emergencies.

Politically, Big Data will enable more effective health policies, better resource allocation, and the anticipation of healthcare needs at the population level. However, I also believe this will depend on the ethical management of data and ensuring patient privacy.

**How do you think technological development will affect user privacy and rights in the future?**

Technological evolution—especially AI and Big Data—poses a major challenge to privacy and cybersecurity. More sophisticated systems will be capable of collecting and analyzing vast amounts of personal data, potentially undermining user rights if strict regulations aren't put in place.

In the future, robust legislation will be needed to protect user privacy and rights, striking a balance between data access and individual freedoms. Blockchain technologies could be key to ensuring security and transparency in data management.

**Do you think Artificial Intelligence will be key to environmental conservation?**

Yes, AI has great potential to be a key tool in environmental conservation due to its ability to process large datasets, detect complex patterns, and optimize processes in real time.

AI could be used to continuously and accurately monitor ecosystems. Through sensor networks, satellites, and drones, AI systems could gather and analyze real-time data on air, water, and soil quality. This would allow faster detection of environmental changes such as deforestation, pollution, or glacier melting compared to traditional methods.

Furthermore, by analyzing historical patterns and weather data, AI can predict events like wildfires, floods, or droughts, enabling better preparedness and quicker responses to mitigate their impact.

**Which Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the 2030 Agenda do you think we are most likely to achieve?**

I agree with my peers that the following are the most attainable:

- **Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7):** Technology and AI will help improve energy efficiency and support the transition to renewable sources.
- **Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9):** Technological innovation will drive more sustainable production methods and more resilient infrastructure.
- **Climate Action (SDG 13):** AI will enhance climate change management through environmental monitoring and prediction of extreme events, while optimizing resource usage.

However, I believe goals related to **poverty eradication (SDG 1)** and **reduced inequalities (SDG 10)** may be harder to achieve without profound political and social transformation.
