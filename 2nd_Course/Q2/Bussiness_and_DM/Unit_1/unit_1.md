## Value Chains

The concept of the "value chain" has been established as a fundamental framework for understanding how companies create value. Coined by Michael E. Porter in 1985, this concept describes a series of activities that a company performs to deliver a product with value to the market. By visualizing the company as a value chain, key processes that contribute to the final value perceived by the customer can be identified and optimized.

A *competitive advantage* is a distinctive characteristic of a company that places it in a superior position compared to its competitors in the market. This advantage can stem from various factors, such as innovation in products or services, superior operational efficiency, a strong brand, advanced technology, exclusive access to the best resources, or exceptional customer relationships.

What makes an advantage competitive is not only its ability to differentiate the company in the market but also its long-term sustainability and the difficulty competitors face in imitating or surpassing it. In essence, a competitive advantage allows a company to create greater value for its customers and shareholders and maintain a leadership position in its industry.

### Definition and Structure

A company's value chain consists of **primary activities** and **support activities**. Primary activities are directly related to creating the product, its sale, delivery, and post-sale maintenance. Support activities provide the necessary infrastructure for primary activities to be carried out efficiently.

**Primary Activities**

- **Inbound Logistics:** Includes receiving, storing, and handling product inputs.
- **Operations:** The transformation of inputs into the final product.
- **Outbound Logistics:** Covers the storage and distribution of the product to customers.
- **Marketing and Sales:** Strategies and processes to promote and sell the product.
- **Service:** Activities aimed at maintaining and improving the product's value, such as after-sales services and customer support.

**Support Activities**

- **Firm Infrastructure:** Includes general management, planning, finance, accounting, and legal affairs.
- **Human Resource Management:** Processes for recruiting, training, developing, and compensating employees.
- **Technology Development:** Investments in research and development, process, and product improvement.
- **Procurement:** The process of acquiring inputs necessary for production.

### Strategic Importance

The value chain is more than an analytical tool; it is a strategic perspective that allows companies to identify where they can create more value. By breaking down the company into specific activities, leaders can analyze and optimize each one, seeking efficiency, cost reduction, and market differentiation.

Value chain analysis involves examining each activity to determine how it contributes to the value perceived by the customer and how it relates to other activities. This analysis helps identify:

- **Sources of Competitive Advantage:** Identifying activities that can provide a competitive advantage, either through lower costs or product differentiation.
- **Interconnections:** Understanding how different activities affect and enhance one another.
- **Optimization Opportunities:** Locating inefficiencies or bottlenecks in activities that can be improved.

Effective implementation of a value chain-based strategy requires a holistic approach. Companies must:

- Align activities with strategy.
- Invest in technology.
- Foster collaboration.
- Focus on the customer.

The value chain is not just a theoretical model but a practical and strategic tool essential for any company seeking to improve its competitiveness. By analyzing and optimizing individual activities and their interactions, companies can significantly increase the value they offer to their customers, thereby improving their market position and long-term profitability.
