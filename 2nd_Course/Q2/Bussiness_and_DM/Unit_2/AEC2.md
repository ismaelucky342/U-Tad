# Introducci√≥n

To introduce this project, I will share my perspective on current business models, as I believe that in the digital world, having a good product or service is not enough; finding an effective way to monetize it is also key. There are multiple strategies to generate revenue, from the freemium models we have seen in this unit to advertising and marketplaces. In this analysis, I will review three companies that I believe have managed to monetize differently from the rest and evaluate how sustainable their models really are in the long term.

## **Notion (Freemium Model)**

### What is its main revenue model?

Notion's primary revenue model is based on the **Freemium** system combined with **subscriptions**. For students, this means offering a free version with limited features and charging for premium plans that unlock advanced tools, especially aimed at teams and businesses.

### How does it implement this model in its business strategy?

I believe Notion has used the freemium model very intelligently: it offers enough value in the free version to attract individual users (students, freelancers, etc.), which generates a broad user base that can later bring the tool to their workplaces or recommend it.

Within the model, there are variations:

- **Personal Pro**: More features for advanced individual users.
- **Team**: Focused on collaboration.
- **Enterprise**: With security, administration, and advanced technical support features.

In other words, its model grows with the user: from someone who just wants to take notes to a company that needs to manage complex projects.

### What are the advantages of this model for Notion?

- **Rapid growth**: Word of mouth has been key. Many people start for free, fall in love with the product, and then recommend or implement it in their company.
- **Recurring revenue**: By relying on monthly or annual subscriptions, Notion ensures a constant source of income.
- **High scalability**: As a digital tool, it can scale without needing to invest proportionally more in infrastructure or staff for each new user.

### What are the challenges or risks of this model?

- **Dependence on freemium**: While it attracts many users, not all convert to paying customers. This can result in a high proportion of users consuming resources without generating direct revenue.
- **Customer retention**: Given that there are many similar tools (like Evernote, ClickUp, or even Google Docs), they must constantly strive to improve the experience to keep users active and loyal.
- **Competition**: The productivity and organization market is saturated. Additionally, they must adapt to different international regulations, especially regarding data privacy and security.

### How has Notion's revenue model evolved over time?

- **Since its launch**, Notion has always been freemium, but initially, it was more focused on individual users. Over time, they have added more robust and customized plans for teams and businesses.
- **New revenue sources**: They have developed specific tools for business use (such as permission management and analytics) and created an active community of template creators who indirectly drive sales by enriching the Notion ecosystem.

### **Additional: Advertising and Influencer Marketing**

I cannot omit what I believe has been one of Notion's great successes: its marketing strategy based on **content creators and influencers**, who promote the tool organically.

**Collaborations with influencers and productivity creators**

Notion has worked with influencers focused on content about productivity, organization, and efficient study/work habits. These creators show how they use Notion in their daily lives, generating interest among their followers and motivating them to try the platform.

Many content creators on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram make tutorials and guides about Notion, highlighting its advantages and customization. Additionally, some influencers receive affiliate codes or direct sponsorships for promoting premium plans.

**Low-cost, high-reach marketing strategy**

This approach has been one of the reasons why Notion has grown without needing to spend large sums on traditional advertising. Instead of relying on paid ads, it has leveraged a community of creators who genuinely enjoy the tool and recommend it.

## **Udemy (Marketplace Model)**

### What is its main revenue model?

Udemy's primary revenue model is **direct course sales**. Each course has a set price (usually affordable), and users purchase them individually. It also has a **subscription** variant for businesses: **Udemy Business**.

### How does it implement this model in its business strategy?

Udemy relies on an **educational marketplace** strategy, where instructors upload their own courses, and the platform handles hosting, promoting, and selling them. The company takes a percentage of each sale.

Variations within the model:

**Individual sales**: Users pay for each course they want.

**Frequent offers**: There are constant promotions and discounts to encourage impulse purchases.

**Udemy Business**: Companies pay a subscription to offer courses to their employees.

**Open marketplace**: Anyone can be an instructor, creating a very diverse range of content.

### What are the advantages of this model for Udemy?

**Massive growth**: By allowing anyone to create and sell courses, the platform has grown exponentially in variety of topics and users.

**Scalability**: Once a course is created, it can be sold to thousands of users without significant additional costs.

**Mixed revenue**: It has both unit revenue (course purchases) and recurring revenue (corporate subscriptions).

**Low content costs**: They don't have to create the courses; users (instructors) do.

### What are the challenges or risks of this model?

**Content saturation**: By allowing anyone to create courses, there is an enormous amount of content, but with significant variation in quality.

**Fierce competition**: Platforms like Coursera, Domestika, edX, and Skillshare offer similar models, sometimes with a more academic or professional focus.

**Retention**: Since there is no subscription for individuals (except corporate offers), there is no recurring revenue from individual users.

**Dependence on discounts**: Many users wait for offers, reducing the perceived value of the course.

### How has this company's revenue model evolved over time?

- Initially, **Udemy was purely a marketplace** with individual courses.
- Over time, they began focusing on the **corporate market**, creating **Udemy Business**, which provides access to a curated library of courses under a subscription.
- They have added **certificates, analytics for businesses**, and other tools to make it more attractive as a professional platform.

## Pinterest (Ad-Based)

### What is its main revenue model?

Pinterest generates most of its revenue through **digital advertising**. Specifically, it uses what they call **"promoted pins"**, which are posts paid for by companies to gain visibility on the platform. They have also incorporated a stronger focus on **e-commerce**, especially with product ads and catalogs directly connected to online stores.

### How does it implement this model in its business strategy?

Pinterest has a strategy heavily focused on **visual inspiration**. People don't visit to see what their friends are doing but rather to look for ideas: how to decorate their home, what to cook, what to wear, where to travel... And that's where the potential lies.

The platform detects these searches and shows related content, but among those results, **promoted pins** also appear, which look almost identical to regular ones. This subtle integration makes the ads less intrusive but still effective.

Additionally, Pinterest has launched several **variations** within its model:

- **Shopping Ads**, which allow brands to connect their product catalogs and directly display prices and images, almost like an integrated store.
- **Idea Pins**, a mix between stories and videos, ideal for creators or brands wanting to showcase a process.
- **Business accounts (Pinterest Business)**, offering advanced tools for those who want to advertise, analyze results, and optimize campaigns.

### What are the advantages of this model for Pinterest?

One of Pinterest's great advantages is that **people are already in "shopping mode"** when browsing. They are looking for things they want to do or have, so the ads are not annoying and sometimes even helpful. This makes their advertising much more effective compared to other networks.

Additionally:

- It is a **highly scalable model**: more users and content mean more data for segmentation and more opportunities to show relevant ads.
- It allows **monetization without overwhelming the user**, as the ads are well-integrated with the platform's general style.
- It attracts very profitable niches, such as fashion, decoration, events, beauty, and cooking.

### What are the challenges or risks of this model?

Pinterest still faces several challenges. The most important, in my opinion, is that it **depends almost exclusively on advertising revenue**. If a brand stops investing or regulations change (e.g., regarding privacy or segmentation), it would be directly affected.

Additionally:

- It competes with giants like Instagram, TikTok, and Google, which have more users and better advertising infrastructure.
- Although they have tried to incorporate features for content creators, **the creator community on Pinterest is still more limited** and less active than on other platforms.
- There is also the challenge of format: **short video dominates currently**, and while Pinterest has been adapting, it is not its original strength.

### How has this company's revenue model evolved over time?

Pinterest started as a very simple platform for boards and saving images, without a clear monetization strategy. Over time, and as its user base grew, they began incorporating **native advertising**, which gradually became more sophisticated.

Later, they entered **e-commerce directly**, allowing brands to connect their catalogs and users to shop from Pinterest without leaving the app.

In recent years, they have also tried to **involve creators** and allow them to earn money from the platform, whether through sponsored pins, affiliate links, or brand collaborations, although this is still in development.

## So‚Ä¶Which model is more sustainable?

After analyzing the revenue models of Udemy, Notion, and Pinterest, I believe the most **sustainable in the long term** is clearly **Notion's**, based on a freemium approach with subscription. Although each model has its own strengths, the combination of recurring revenue, an active community that supports it, and the ability to scale with low operational costs makes Notion's model more stable and solid over time.

### Why do I consider Notion's model more sustainable?

What convinces me most about the freemium model with subscription is that it **balances user growth with constant revenue generation**. Notion can offer a very attractive free version, generating a massive user base and fostering organic adoption (word of mouth), while at the same time converting some of those users into paying customers, especially when used in professional or team contexts.

Additionally, the subscription is **scalable without needing to radically change the product**. As the number of users or companies adopting Notion as their work tool grows, revenue also grows. And since they don't have to invest in physical infrastructure (like a store or network of hired instructors), they can keep costs low.

Another important point is that **they don't rely on a single revenue channel**. Although the core is the subscription, Notion has also started integrating with third-party ecosystems, plugins, templates, and community, opening new opportunities for indirect monetization without losing focus.

### Comparison with Udemy and Pinterest

In the case of **Udemy**, its marketplace model also has a great scalability advantage, especially because it doesn't need to generate its own content. However, this same aspect represents a risk: **quality control is difficult**, and in a market with so much competition (Coursera, edX, Domestika), differentiation is increasingly challenging. Additionally, its model heavily depends on aggressive promotions and shared commissions with creators, reducing profit margins.

**Pinterest**, on the other hand, has a completely different model. By relying 100% on advertising, its revenue is **closely tied to external factors**, such as other companies' marketing spending, privacy regulations, and competition with platforms offering similar formats (like Instagram or TikTok). Although they have a very loyal visual community, they lack a more predictable revenue channel that is less exposed to market changes. If advertising investment decreases, Pinterest suffers directly.

### Improvement Proposals I See

**For Udemy**: I think one way to make its model more sustainable would be to **focus more on premium subscriptions**, as they are already doing with ‚ÄúUdemy Business,‚Äù but also extending it to individual users. A hybrid model would provide stability without relying on isolated sales.

**For Notion**: They could continue growing by creating an **ecosystem of template or extension creators**, with an integrated store. This would not only generate shared revenue but also strengthen the community and retention. I also think one of their main problems is their attempt to do too much (AI, attempts to replace Google Calendar, etc.) when they could dedicate the platform as a center for academic, work, and daily habit organization.

**For Pinterest**: The best strategy would be to **diversify beyond advertising**. For example, they could charge commissions for purchases made directly from the app or launch premium plans for creators or small brands wanting advanced visibility tools.

### My Final Conclusion

In such a rapidly changing market, where technology advances quickly and user habits constantly evolve, **models that combine flexibility with recurring revenue** are the ones with the best chances of lasting. For this reason, I find Notion's approach the most sustainable: not only because of how it generates revenue but also because of how it is building community, product, and long-term vision.
