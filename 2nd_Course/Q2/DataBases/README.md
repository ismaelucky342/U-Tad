### **Course Overview**

This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of relational databases and relational algebra, providing the theoretical foundation necessary to work with relational databases and the SQL language. Students will gain a deep understanding of SQL as a standard language for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL and MariaDB. Practical applications of database management will be emphasized through hands-on experience with these systems. The course also covers advanced database topics, including database design, optimization, and normalization, as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB. This course will equip students with the skills needed for effective database administration, design, and optimization, making them valuable assets in the technology field.

### **Learning Outcomes**

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply the relational model and relational algebra to design and query databases.
- Use SQL to create, modify, and query relational databases efficiently.
- Design and implement normalized database schemas to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.
- Perform database optimization to improve query performance and storage efficiency.
- Administer MySQL and MariaDB databases, including backup, recovery, and security management.
- Understand the differences between relational and NoSQL databases, with an introduction to MongoDB.

### **Course Units**

1. **Unit 1: Introduction to Databases**
    - This unit provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of databases, explaining their importance in modern computing and technology. Topics include database types, the role of databases in various applications, and basic concepts like tables, records, and keys.
2. **Unit 2: Relational Model and Relational Algebra**
    - Students will learn about the relational model and relational algebra, the theoretical foundation of relational databases. This unit will cover fundamental concepts like sets, relations, operations (such as union, intersection, difference, and join), and how these operations are applied to relational databases.
3. **Unit 3: Advanced SQL Language**
    - This unit focuses on advanced SQL techniques, including subqueries, joins, aggregation, grouping, and window functions. Students will learn how to write complex SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data from relational databases.
4. **Unit 4: MySQL Access and Storage**
    - This unit explores how MySQL manages database storage, indexing, and access. Students will learn about different types of indexes, optimization techniques, and how to design efficient databases for high performance.
5. **Unit 5: Database Administration in MySQL**
    - Students will be introduced to the administration of MySQL databases, learning how to perform backup and recovery, implement security measures, manage users and permissions, and monitor database performance.
6. **Unit 6: Advanced Relational Database Topics and Introduction to NoSQL**
    - This unit expands on relational databases by covering advanced topics such as distributed databases and cloud computing. It also introduces students to NoSQL databases like MongoDB, focusing on their differences from relational databases and when to use them effectively.
