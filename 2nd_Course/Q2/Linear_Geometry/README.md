## **Course Overview**

Affine and projective spaces, topological spaces, and the Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces are the central aspects of this subject.

Affine spaces constitute the mathematical model created to model our intuitive idea of space, being the most suitable environment in which to carry out all kinds of geometric operations (movements, trajectories, physical forces, etc.). It is therefore the model in which a large number of applications with a geometric component present in disciplines such as architecture, engineering, or physics, among others, are developed.

On the other hand, projective geometry is established as the model that collects the way in which the human eye or a camera represents (projects) the 3D information of reality onto a 2D image or plane.

In this subject, we work from the structure of the metric affine space to study and classify isometries and movements in the plane and three-dimensional Euclidean space. Projective spaces, their varieties and projectivities are studied, and a study of conics and quadrics is carried out.
