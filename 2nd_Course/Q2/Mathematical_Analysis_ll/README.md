## **Course Overview**

The objective of this course is for students to develop the ability to understand and construct rigorous mathematical proofs, while gaining a solid understanding and command of the fundamental concepts and techniques of differential and integral calculus. Once students are confident in single-variable calculus, this course prepares them for generalization to multivariable contexts and the study of complex-valued functions.

The objective of Mathematical Analysis II is to extend the basic concepts of single-variable differential calculus to several variables, from both a theoretical and computational point of view. Additionally, this subject allows students to become familiar with the most common forms of representation in the plane and three-dimensional space through the study of different coordinate systems, lines, planes, and curves.
