# Distributed Systems in Home Environments: A Comprehensive Research Study

## Abstract

This research examines the implementation and analysis of distributed systems within residential network infrastructures, demonstrating how distributed computing principles can be applied using consumer-grade hardware to replicate enterprise-level services and architectures.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Distributed systems have become fundamental to modern computing infrastructure, enabling scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization. Traditionally confined to enterprise and cloud environments, these architectural patterns are increasingly accessible for small-scale implementations.

### 1.2 Research Objectives
- Analyze the practical deployment of distributed services in home environments
- Evaluate performance characteristics and bottlenecks in resource-constrained scenarios
- Demonstrate the applicability of distributed systems theory to consumer-grade infrastructure

### 1.3 Scope
This study focuses on self-hosted services deployed across multiple nodes within a residential network, examining their behavior under real-world operational conditions.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Distributed Systems Fundamentals

**Definition**: A distributed system consists of multiple autonomous computing entities that communicate through message passing to achieve common objectives while appearing as a single coherent system to end users.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Concurrency**: Multiple processes execute simultaneously across different nodes
- **Lack of Global Clock**: No single time reference exists across all components
- **Independent Failures**: Components may fail independently without affecting the entire system
- **Transparency**: System distribution is hidden from users (access, location, migration, replication, concurrency, and failure transparency)

### 2.2 CAP Theorem
According to Brewer's CAP theorem, distributed systems can guarantee at most two of three properties:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- **Availability**: Every request receives a response
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues operating despite network partitions

### 2.3 Distributed System Models

**Client-Server Architecture**: Centralized servers provide resources to multiple clients
**Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: Nodes act as both clients and servers
**Microservices**: Applications decomposed into loosely coupled, independently deployable services

## 3. Implemented Services and Architecture

## 4. Infrastructure Architecture

### 4.1 Network Topology
Services distributed across heterogeneous hardware nodes within a private LAN environment, utilizing standard TCP/IP protocols for inter-node communication.

### 4.2 Resource Distribution Strategy
- **Workload Isolation**: Services assigned to dedicated nodes based on resource requirements
- **Load Balancing**: Manual distribution preventing single-node saturation
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures contained to individual nodes

### 4.3 Data Management
- **Centralized Storage**: Shared network-attached storage for common data
- **Local Caching**: Node-level temporary storage for performance optimization
- **Backup Strategy**: Redundant data copies across multiple physical locations

## 5. Performance Analysis

### 5.1 Network Latency

**Theoretical Context**: Network delay is inherent to distributed systems, governed by physical distance, routing complexity, and bandwidth limitations.

**Measurement Methodology**: Round-trip time (RTT) analysis between nodes under various load conditions

**Observed Impact**:
- Average latency: 1-5ms within LAN
- Service response times degraded by 20-40% compared to localhost
- Real-time services (RustDesk) most affected by latency variance

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Minimizing network hops through optimal routing
- Protocol optimization (UDP for latency-sensitive operations)
- Local caching to reduce remote requests

### 5.2 Storage I/O Bottlenecks

**Theoretical Context**: Disk I/O contention occurs when multiple processes compete for storage access, governed by physical disk characteristics and filesystem implementation.

**Observed Issues**:
- HDD-based storage exhibited 10x slower access times under concurrent load
- Sequential operations degraded to random access patterns with multiple services
- IOPS limitations became apparent with >3 concurrent heavy operations

**Implemented Solutions**:
- **SSD Migration**: Transitioned critical services to solid-state storage (5-10x IOPS improvement)
- **Service Distribution**: Allocated I/O-intensive services to separate physical disks
- **I/O Scheduling**: Implemented deadline schedulers for predictable latency

### 5.3 Concurrent Request Handling

**Analysis**: Service performance under multiple simultaneous client connections

**Results**:
- Linear performance degradation up to 5 concurrent users
- Exponential degradation beyond resource threshold
- Memory limitations became apparent before CPU saturation

### 5.4 Scalability Constraints

**Vertical Scaling Limitations**: Consumer hardware constraints (RAM, CPU cores, storage)
**Horizontal Scaling Challenges**: Service coordination overhead increases with node count
