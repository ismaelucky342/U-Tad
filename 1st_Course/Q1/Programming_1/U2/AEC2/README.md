## Exercise 1

The user is first prompted to input their weight, weight unit, height, and height unit. Then, the weight and height units are verified to perform the necessary conversions to kilograms and meters, respectively. Finally, the BMI is calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters, and the result is displayed on the screen.

## Exercise 2

A counter variable is used to keep track of the numbers divisible by 3. Additionally, a sum variable is used to accumulate the sum of all numbers divisible by 3. At the end of the loop, the arithmetic mean is calculated by dividing the total sum by the number of elements. To perform this division, the operands are converted to real numbers using the `Real()` function. Finally, the result is displayed on the screen using the `Write` instruction.

## Exercise 3

In this exercise, float variables are used to store the values of height, weight, and BMI. The user is prompted to input the height and weight values. After entering the data, the BMI is calculated using the formula `weight / (height * height)`. Finally, the result is displayed on the screen. The displayed result is rounded to two decimal places for better readability.

## Exercise 4

For this last exercise, integer variables are used to store the values of numbers `a` and `b`, the greatest common divisor (gcd), and the result. At the beginning of the algorithm, the `gcd` and `result` variables are initialized to 0. Then, the values of `a` and `b` are compared. If they are equal, the value is stored in the `result` variable. Otherwise, a `while` loop is used to compare the values of `a` and `b`. In each iteration of the loop, the smaller number is subtracted from the larger number, and the result is stored in the smaller number. When the values of `a` and `b` are equal, the value is stored in the `result` variable. Finally, the result is displayed.
