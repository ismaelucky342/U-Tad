# Propositional Logic Simulator

## Objective  
Create a simulator to represent and evaluate propositional logic expressions. Students must implement the basic logical operations such as:  
- Conjunction  
- Disjunction  
- Negation  
- Implication  
- Biconditional  

## Requirements  

1. **Classes to represent propositions and logical operations**  
    Implement classes to model propositions and basic logical operations.  

2. **Input for logical expressions**  
    Allow users to input logical expressions in a standard notation (e.g., as a text string).  

3. **Expression evaluation**  
    Evaluate the validity of expressions for different combinations of truth values.  

4. **Truth table**  
    Display a truth table for each entered expression.  

## Possible Extension  

- **Expression simplification**  
  Add the ability to simplify logical expressions.  

- **Satisfiability verification**  
  Implement formula satisfiability verification using algorithms like DPLL.
