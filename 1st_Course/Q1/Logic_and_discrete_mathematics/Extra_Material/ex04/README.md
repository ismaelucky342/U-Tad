# Binary Relations and Equivalence Graphs Simulator  

## Objective  
Create a simulator for binary relations that allows representing equivalences and partial orders, visualizing them as graphs.  

## Requirements  

- Create a graph to represent binary relations between the elements of a set.  
- Implement operations for equivalence (symmetry, reflexivity, transitivity) and order (irreflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity).  
- Visualize the results using graphical libraries such as `matplotlib` or `networkx`.  

## Possible Extension  

- Implement functions to detect and display connected components or equivalence classes in the graph.  
- Add the ability to order elements using an algorithm like topological sorting if the relations form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
