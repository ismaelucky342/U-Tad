# Combinations and Permutations Generator

## Objective
Create a generator capable of producing all possible combinations and permutations of a given set, as well as efficiently calculating the total number of combinations/permutations.

## Requirements
- Implement a function to generate all permutations and combinations of a given set of elements.
- Calculate the total number of combinations and permutations without generating all sequences.
- Implement the function in Python using recursion or iterative techniques.

## Possible Extension
- Incorporate probabilities and analyze how many combinations satisfy a specific property, such as having a value greater than a given number.
