# Dijkstra's Algorithm for Graphs

## Objective  
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

## Requirements  

1. Create a graph data structure using an adjacency list.  
2. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.  
3. Display the shortest path and the minimum distance.  

## Possible Extension  

- Extend the implementation to work with both directed and undirected graphs.  
- Add an option to display the shortest path tree from a source node.
