# Expression Tree Generator and Evaluator  

## Objective  
Create a generator and evaluator for mathematical expression trees. The student must implement a binary tree to represent operations and operands.  

## Requirements  
- Build a binary tree where internal nodes represent mathematical operators, and leaf nodes represent operands.  
- Implement the evaluation of the expression tree to obtain the result of the operation.  

## Possible Extension  
- Allow expression trees to include linear algebra operations (e.g., sums, matrix multiplication, etc.).  
- Add an interface to enable users to input mathematical expressions.
