# Decision Trees for Logic Problems  

## Objective  
Create a program that builds and solves decision trees for propositional logic problems.  

## Requirements  
- Implement a decision tree structure where each node represents a question or logical proposition.  
- Use the decision tree to solve logical problems through a search for the final answer.  

## Possible Extensions  
- Create a graphical interface to visualize the decision tree.  
- Implement an algorithm to optimize the decision tree based on certain criteria (e.g., minimizing the number of nodes).
