# Binary Trees and Traversal Algorithms  

## Objective  
Create an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and enable different types of traversal (preorder, inorder, and postorder).  

## Requirements  

- Implement a binary tree class with methods to insert, delete, and search for nodes.  
- Implement traversal algorithms (preorder, inorder, postorder).  
- Allow the user to input a sequence of elements and construct a binary tree.  

## Possible Extension  

- Implement node deletion in a binary tree, considering special cases (e.g., when the node has two children).  
- Implement a tree balancing method (such as an AVL tree or Red-Black tree).
