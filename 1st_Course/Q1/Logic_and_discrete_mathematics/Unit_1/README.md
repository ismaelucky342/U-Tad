## **Unit 1: Logic**

### 📌 **1. What is Logic?**

Logic is the study of reasoning, arguments, and the principles that determine the validity of conclusions drawn from premises. It is foundational to disciplines like mathematics, computer science, and philosophy. By understanding logic, we can distinguish between valid and invalid reasoning, construct formal systems to describe and analyze arguments, and apply these principles to solve real-world problems effectively.

### 🔤 **2. Propositions**

A **proposition** is a declarative statement that can be either **true** or **false**. Propositions are the building blocks of logical reasoning. The truth value of a proposition is either:

- **True (T):** The proposition corresponds to reality (e.g., "The sky is blue").
- **False (F):** The proposition does not correspond to reality (e.g., "The sky is green").

**Examples of Propositions:**

- "2 + 2 = 4" → **True**
- "The Earth is flat" → **False**
- "The moon is made of cheese" → **False**

However, not all sentences are propositions. **Questions** (e.g., "What time is it?") and **commands** (e.g., "Close the door.") are not propositions because they cannot be assigned a truth value of true or false.

### 🔗 **3. Logical Connectors (Operators)**

Logical connectives or **connectors** are symbols that combine propositions to form more complex logical expressions. The most common logical connectives are:

| Connector | Name | Symbol | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ¬p | Negation | ¬ | Not p (the opposite of p) | If p is "It is raining", ¬p means "It is not raining." |
| p ∧ q | Conjunction | ∧ | p and q (both p and q must be true) | "It is raining" ∧ "It is cold" means "It is both raining and cold." |
| p ∨ q | Disjunction | ∨ | p or q (at least one of p or q must be true) | "It is raining" ∨ "It is sunny" means "It is either raining or sunny." |
| p → q | Implication | → | If p, then q (if p is true, then q must also be true) | "If it rains, then the ground is wet." |
| p ↔ q | Biconditional | ↔ | p if and only if q (p and q must have the same truth value) | "It rains if and only if the sky is cloudy." |

Each connector allows us to form compound propositions by combining simpler ones. Understanding their meanings is key to analyzing logical arguments and constructing valid reasoning.

### 📊 **4. Truth Tables**

A **truth table** is a tool used to represent the possible truth values of a logical expression based on the truth values of its components. The table systematically lists all combinations of truth values for the individual propositions and shows the resulting truth value of the whole expression.

#### Example: Truth Table for Conjunction (p ∧ q)

| p | q | p ∧ q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | F |
| F | F | F |

- The conjunction (p ∧ q) is true only when both p and q are true.

#### Example: Truth Table for Implication (p → q)

| p | q | p → q |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T |
| T | F | F |
| F | T | T |
| F | F | T |

- An implication (p → q) is false only when p is true and q is false. In all other cases, it is true.

Truth tables are essential for understanding the behavior of logical expressions and verifying their correctness.

### 🔢 **5. Logical Equivalences**

Two logical expressions are considered **logically equivalent** if they always produce the same truth values in every possible scenario. These equivalences allow us to simplify complex expressions and prove that different logical statements are equivalent.

#### Common Logical Equivalences:

- **Double Negation:**
    
    ¬(¬p) ≡ p
    
    - The negation of the negation of a proposition is equivalent to the original proposition.
    
- **De Morgan's Laws:**
    - ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q
    - ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q
    - These laws help us simplify expressions involving negations of conjunctions and disjunctions.
    
- **Implication Equivalence:**
    
    p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q
    
    - An implication "if p then q" is equivalent to "not p or q."

Logical equivalences are powerful tools for transforming and analyzing logical expressions.

### 📝 **6. Validity and Argument Forms**

An **argument** consists of a set of premises and a conclusion. The goal of logic is to determine whether an argument is valid. An argument is **valid** if, assuming the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.

#### Example of a Valid Argument (Modus Ponens):

1. **Premise 1**: If it rains, then the ground will be wet (p → q).
2. **Premise 2**: It is raining (p).
3. **Conclusion**: The ground will be wet (q).

This argument is valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.

#### Common Argument Forms:

- **Modus Ponens**:
    
    p → q, p ⟹ q
    
    (If p implies q, and p is true, then q must be true.)
    
- **Modus Tollens**:
    
    p → q, ¬q ⟹ ¬p
    
    (If p implies q, and q is false, then p must also be false.)
    
- **Disjunctive Syllogism**:
    
    p ∨ q, ¬p ⟹ q
    
    (If either p or q is true, and p is false, then q must be true.)

Understanding these forms is crucial for constructing and evaluating logical arguments.

### ⚖️ **7. Logical Fallacies**

A **logical fallacy** is an error in reasoning that renders an argument invalid. Recognizing fallacies is important for avoiding flawed reasoning.

#### Common Logical Fallacies:

- **Affirming the Consequent**:
    
    p → q, q ⟹ p
    
    (This is invalid reasoning. Just because q is true does not necessarily mean p is true.)
    
- **Denying the Antecedent**:
    
    p → q, ¬p ⟹ ¬q
    
    (This is also invalid reasoning. Just because p is false does not mean q is false.)

Logical fallacies undermine the validity of arguments and should be avoided in sound reasoning.

### 🧮 **8. Quantifiers in Logic**

In predicate logic, we use **quantifiers** to express statements about quantities. There are two main types of quantifiers:

- **Universal Quantifier (∀)**:
    
    "For all..."
    
    Example: ∀x (x > 0 → x² > 0)
    
    This means "For all x, if x is greater than 0, then x squared is greater than 0."
    
- **Existential Quantifier (∃)**:
    
    "There exists..."
    
    Example: ∃x (x² = 4)
    
    This means "There exists an x such that x squared equals 4."

Quantifiers allow us to generalize or specify logical statements, making them more expressive.

### 🔍 **9. Application of Logic**

Logic is applied in many areas of life, from computer programming and artificial intelligence to law and everyday decision-making. Formal logic helps in constructing algorithms, verifying the correctness of systems, and analyzing complex problems. By mastering logic, we can enhance our critical thinking skills and make better decisions in various domains.
