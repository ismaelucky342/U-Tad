This project is a small analysis that will address the issue of numerical precision and potential "overflow" in the calculation of various quantities related to complex numbers.

Students will be asked to analyze what numerical errors can occur when using complex numbers in the languages: C++, Java, and Python. Likewise, students must propose solutions to these potential errors in each of the languages analyzed.

# Project 

### Analysis 

To initiate our analysis, I will begin by noting that, akin to many peers, I have not previously utilized Python, necessitating research on the subject. Nonetheless, it is evident that understanding numerical errors prevalent across the three languages is crucial, leading to overflows and precision challenges. Consequently, we must evaluate potential solutions. Primarily, I will delve into the potential issues within each language.
In C++, complex numbers find representation through the standard library complex. However, akin to any numerical computation, certain issues may arise, including numerical precision and potential overflow. To circumvent overflow, the long long data type proves effective in representing large integers.
Java, conversely, lacks native support for complex numbers, necessitating the implementation of a custom class. Similar to C++, numerical precision and overflow pose potential concerns. Nonetheless, Java features double-precision floating-point data types, offering some mitigation.
Python stands out with its native support for complex numbers, facilitating manipulation. Complex numbers in Python are directly definable using syntax such as a + bj or via the complex() function. Python also permits access to the real and imaginary parts through the .real and .imag attributes, respectively.
However, akin to any numerical computation, numerical precision emerges as a potential stumbling block. Python utilizes double-precision floating-point types to represent the real and imaginary components of a complex number.

### Proposed Solutions

- C++:
  
To address numerical precision in complex numbers, leveraging the C++ standard library proves beneficial, with the std::complex class template in the <complex> header offering floating-point precision in mathematical operations.
To tackle overflow concerns, the C++ standard library provides solutions. For instance, utilizing functions like std::numeric_limits::max() allows for pre-operation checks to determine if a number exceeds predefined limits.
- Java:
  
In Java, employing the BigDecimal class enables the handling of numerical precision in complex numbers. This class offers arithmetic operations with comprehensive control over precision and scale, accommodating significantly large numbers.
To manage overflow issues, Java incorporates built-in mechanisms. For example, the Math class features methods like addExact, subtractExact, and multiplyExact, which throw exceptions upon overflow occurrences.
- Python:
  
Within Python, the cmath module offers a solution for handling complex numbers with numerical precision, while the numpy library provides the numpy.complex128 type, offering high precision.
Regarding overflow, Pythonâ€™s intrinsic feature grants integers arbitrary precision, alleviating concerns. However, for computations involving floating-point numbers, utilizing the decimal library ensures heightened precision.
