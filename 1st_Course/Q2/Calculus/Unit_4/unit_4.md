# Unit 4: Function Interpolation

Graphical representation is not the only way to approach a function. Function interpolation using polynomials emerges as a powerful alternative to approximate and analyze functions. Taylor's theorem and Lagrange's interpolation method provide us with tools to approximate functions using polynomials from a local perspective, focusing on the vicinity of a specific point, and from a global perspective, considering an entire interval.

# Graphical Representation of Functions
We first introduce the concept of an asymptote, which, along with the concepts studied in previous units, helps us sketch the graph of a function.
