# Unit 6: Linear Transformations – Detailed Overview

**Linear transformations** are essential concepts in linear algebra and are closely related to vector spaces. Linear transformations describe how vectors in one vector space can be mapped to vectors in another vector space while preserving the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication. Understanding linear transformations is fundamental to many areas of mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering, as they provide a framework for understanding how different systems or structures can be transformed.

### 1. **Definition of a Linear Transformation**

A **linear transformation** (or **linear map**) is a function `T: V → W` between two vector spaces `V` and `W` over the same field `F` that satisfies the following two properties:

1. **Additivity**: For all vectors `u, v ∈ V`:
    ```math
    T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)
    ```

2. **Homogeneity (Scalar Multiplication)**: For all vectors `v ∈ V` and scalars `c ∈ F`:
    ```math
    T(c ⋅ v) = c ⋅ T(v)
    ```

These two conditions ensure that the transformation preserves the structure of the vector space, meaning that it maps sums of vectors to sums, and scalar multiples to scalar multiples.

### 2. **Examples of Linear Transformations**

- **Scaling Transformation**: A transformation that multiplies every vector by a constant scalar. For example:
  ```math
  T(v) = c ⋅ v
  ```
  where `c` is a constant scalar.

- **Rotation**: A linear transformation that rotates vectors in a plane or space while preserving their magnitudes.

- **Reflection**: A transformation that reflects vectors across a subspace (e.g., a line in 2D or a plane in 3D).

- **Shearing**: A transformation that distorts the shape of objects in a vector space by shifting points along a given axis.

- **Zero Transformation**: The transformation:
  ```math
  T(v) = 0
  ```
  for all `v ∈ V`, which sends every vector to the zero vector.

### 3. **Matrix Representation of Linear Transformations**

Any linear transformation `T: V → W` between finite-dimensional vector spaces can be represented by a matrix. The matrix representation allows the transformation to be applied efficiently, especially in the context of systems of linear equations and computations.

Given that `V` is an `n`-dimensional vector space and `W` is an `m`-dimensional vector space, the linear transformation `T` can be represented by an `m × n` matrix `A`, where the action of `T` on a vector `v ∈ V` is given by matrix multiplication:

```math
T(v) = A ⋅ v
```

The matrix `A` is called the **matrix representation** of the linear transformation `T` in the standard bases of `V` and `W`.

### 4. **Properties of Linear Transformations**

Linear transformations have several important properties that can be derived from their definition:

- **Composition of Linear Transformations**: If `T₁: V → W` and `T₂: W → U` are linear transformations, their composition `T₂ ∘ T₁: V → U` is also a linear transformation:
  ```math
  (T₂ ∘ T₁)(v) = T₂(T₁(v))
  ```

- **Invertibility of Linear Transformations**: A linear transformation `T: V → W` is invertible if there exists another linear transformation `T⁻¹: W → V` such that:
  ```math
  T⁻¹(T(v)) = v \quad \text{for all} \quad v ∈ V
  ```
  If `T` is invertible, it is also called an **isomorphism**.

- **Kernel and Image (Null Space and Range)**:
  - **Kernel (Null Space)**: The **kernel** (or **null space**) of a linear transformation `T: V → W`, denoted `Ker(T)`, is the set of all vectors `v ∈ V` such that:
     ```math
     Ker(T) = {v ∈ V | T(v) = 0}
     ```
     The kernel provides insight into how much the transformation "flattens" or "collapses" vectors to the zero vector.

  - **Image (Range)**: The **image** (or **range**) of `T`, denoted `Im(T)`, is the set of all vectors `T(v) ∈ W` for some `v ∈ V`:
     ```math
     Im(T) = {T(v) | v ∈ V}
     ```
     The image represents the "output" of the transformation and describes how the vectors in `V` are mapped into `W`.

### 5. **Matrix Operations on Linear Transformations**

Linear transformations can be manipulated using matrix operations, which provide powerful tools for analyzing their properties:

- **Addition of Linear Transformations**: If `T₁` and `T₂` are linear transformations, their sum `T₁ + T₂` is also a linear transformation, and its matrix representation is the sum of the matrices:
  ```math
  A_{T₁ + T₂} = A_{T₁} + A_{T₂}
  ```

- **Scalar Multiplication**: A linear transformation can be scaled by a scalar `c`, and its matrix representation is scaled by the same scalar:
  ```math
  A_{cT} = c ⋅ A_T
  ```

- **Composition of Linear Transformations**: The matrix representation of the composition of two linear transformations `T₁` and `T₂` is the product of the matrices:
  ```math
  A_{T₁ ∘ T₂} = A_{T₁} ⋅ A_{T₂}
  ```

- **Inverse of a Linear Transformation**: If `T` is invertible, its matrix representation `A_T` is also invertible, and the inverse of the transformation corresponds to the inverse of the matrix:
  ```math
  A_{T⁻¹} = A_T⁻¹
  ```

### 6. **Isomorphisms and Invertible Linear Transformations**

An **isomorphism** is a linear transformation that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). An isomorphism preserves the structure of vector spaces, meaning that it maps one vector space to another without distortion.

- **Injectivity (One-to-one)**: A linear transformation `T: V → W` is injective if different vectors in `V` are mapped to different vectors in `W`. This is equivalent to the kernel of `T` containing only the zero vector:
  ```math
  Ker(T) = {0}
  ```

- **Surjectivity (Onto)**: A linear transformation `T: V → W` is surjective if every vector in `W` has a preimage in `V`. This is equivalent to the image of `T` being equal to the entire vector space `W`:
  ```math
  Im(T) = W
  ```

- If a linear transformation is both injective and surjective, it is invertible, meaning there exists a linear transformation `T⁻¹` such that:
  ```math
  T⁻¹(T(v)) = v \quad \text{for all} \quad v ∈ V
  ```

### 7. **Applications of Linear Transformations**

Linear transformations are used extensively in various fields of mathematics and science. Some important applications include:

- **Computer Graphics**: In computer graphics, linear transformations such as rotations, scaling, and translations are used to manipulate images and 3D objects.
- **Signal Processing**: Linear transformations are used in the analysis and processing of signals, where transformations like the Fourier transform help in analyzing different frequency components.
- **Optimization**: Linear transformations play a crucial role in linear programming and optimization, where they help model constraints and objective functions.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: In quantum mechanics, linear transformations are used to describe the evolution of quantum states and operators.
- **Machine Learning**: In machine learning, linear transformations are used in various algorithms, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is used for dimensionality reduction.

### 8. **Change of Basis and Linear Transformations**

Linear transformations can be analyzed and simplified by changing the basis of the vector spaces involved. A change of basis allows us to represent the same transformation in a different coordinate system, often making computations easier.

- **Change of Basis in a Vector Space**: If `B = {b₁, b₂, ..., bₙ}` is a basis for a vector space `V`, any vector `v ∈ V` can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors:
    ```math
    v = c₁b₁ + c₂b₂ + ... + cₙbₙ
    ```
    The coefficients `c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ` form the coordinates of `v` in the basis `B`.

- **Matrix Representation in a New Basis**: If `T: V → V` is a linear transformation and `B` is a basis for `V`, the matrix representation of `T` in the basis `B` is given by:
    ```math
    [T]_B = P⁻¹AP
    ```
    where `A` is the matrix representation of `T` in the standard basis, and `P` is the change-of-basis matrix.

### 9. **Diagonalization of Linear Transformations**

Diagonalization is a process of finding a basis in which the matrix representation of a linear transformation is diagonal. A diagonal matrix is easier to work with, as its entries represent the eigenvalues of the transformation.

- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: An eigenvector of a linear transformation `T: V → V` is a nonzero vector `v ∈ V` such that:
    ```math
    T(v) = λv
    ```
    where `λ` is the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector `v`.

- **Diagonalization Criterion**: A linear transformation `T` is diagonalizable if there exists a basis of `V` consisting entirely of eigenvectors of `T`. In this case, the matrix representation of `T` in this basis is diagonal.

- **Applications of Diagonalization**: Diagonalization is widely used in solving systems of linear differential equations, analyzing stability in dynamical systems, and simplifying computations in quantum mechanics.

### 10. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**

Singular Value Decomposition is a generalization of diagonalization for non-square matrices. It is a powerful tool in linear algebra with applications in data science, machine learning, and numerical analysis.

- **Definition**: For any matrix `A ∈ ℝ^(m×n)`, the SVD is given by:
    ```math
    A = UΣVᵀ
    ```
    where:
    - `U` is an `m×m` orthogonal matrix.
    - `Σ` is an `m×n` diagonal matrix with non-negative entries called singular values.
    - `V` is an `n×n` orthogonal matrix.

- **Applications of SVD**:
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: SVD is used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving as much variance as possible.
    - **Image Compression**: SVD is used to compress images by approximating them with lower-rank matrices.
    - **Recommender Systems**: SVD is used in collaborative filtering algorithms to predict user preferences.

### 11. **Linear Transformations in Differential Equations**

Linear transformations are fundamental in the study of differential equations, particularly in systems of linear differential equations.

- **Homogeneous Systems**: A system of linear differential equations can be written in matrix form as:
    ```math
    \frac{dX}{dt} = AX
    ```
    where `X` is a vector of functions and `A` is a matrix representing the linear transformation.

- **Solution Using Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: The solution to the system can often be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of `A`.

- **Applications**: Linear transformations in differential equations are used in modeling physical systems, such as electrical circuits, mechanical vibrations, and population dynamics.

### 12. **Linear Transformations in Machine Learning**

Linear transformations are a core component of many machine learning algorithms and models.

- **Neural Networks**: In neural networks, linear transformations are used in the form of weight matrices to map inputs to outputs in each layer.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like PCA and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) rely on linear transformations to reduce the dimensionality of data while preserving important features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Linear transformations are used to create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
