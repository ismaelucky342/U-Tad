# Unit 1: Complex Numbers – Overview

This unit introduces **complex numbers**, which are numbers that extend the concept of real numbers to include the square root of negative numbers. Complex numbers have numerous applications in algebra, engineering, physics, and other fields.

### 1. **Definition of Complex Numbers**

- A **complex number** is a number of the form: `z = a + bi`

    where:

    - `a` is the **real part** (denoted as `Re(z)`),
    - `b` is the **imaginary part** (denoted as `Im(z)`),
    - `i` is the **imaginary unit**, where `i^2 = -1`.

- **Real numbers** are complex numbers where the imaginary part is zero (`b = 0`).
- **Pure imaginary numbers** are complex numbers where the real part is zero (`a = 0`).

### 2. **Operations with Complex Numbers**

- **Addition**: Add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:
    ```math
    (a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
    ```

- **Subtraction**: Subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately:
    ```math
    (a + bi) - (c + di) = (a - c) + (b - d)i
    ```

- **Multiplication**: Use the distributive property and apply `i^2 = -1`:
    ```math
    (a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
    ```

- **Division**: Multiply the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:
    ```math
    \frac{a + bi}{c + di} = \frac{(a + bi)(c - di)}{(c + di)(c - di)} = \frac{(ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i}{c^2 + d^2}
    ```

- **Complex Conjugate**: The **conjugate** of `z = a + bi` is:
    ```math
    \overline{z} = a - bi
    ```

### 3. **Modulus and Argument**

- **Modulus** (or **absolute value**) of a complex number `z = a + bi` is given by:
    ```math
    |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
    ```
    It represents the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane.

- **Argument** of a complex number `z = a + bi`, denoted `arg(z)`, is the angle `\theta` that the complex number makes with the positive real axis. It can be computed using:
    ```math
    \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)
    ```
    for `a ≠ 0`, and taking into account the quadrant in which `z` lies.

### 4. **Polar Form of Complex Numbers**

- A complex number can be expressed in **polar form** as:
    ```math
    z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
    ```
    where:

    - `r = |z|` is the modulus,
    - `\theta = \arg(z)` is the argument.

- This form is often written using Euler's formula:
    ```math
    z = r e^{i\theta}
    ```
    This representation is particularly useful in multiplication and division of complex numbers.

### 5. **De Moivre's Theorem**

- **De Moivre's Theorem** is a formula that allows us to raise complex numbers in polar form to integer powers:
    ```math
    (r e^{i\theta})^n = r^n e^{in\theta}
    ```
    where `n` is an integer. This is particularly useful in solving complex equations and in finding roots of complex numbers.

### 6. **Roots of Complex Numbers**

- The **n-th roots** of a complex number `z = r e^{i\theta}` are given by:
    ```math
    \sqrt[n]{r} e^{i\left(\frac{\theta + 2k\pi}{n}\right)}
    ```
    for `k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1`. This results in `n` distinct roots, equally spaced on the complex plane's circle.

### 7. **Applications of Complex Numbers**

- **Solving Polynomial Equations**: The **Fundamental Theorem of Algebra** states that every non-constant polynomial equation has at least one complex root. This is useful in solving equations that do not have real solutions.
- **Electrical Engineering**: Complex numbers are used to represent alternating current (AC) circuits, where the voltage and current are described as complex quantities.
- **Control Systems**: In control theory, complex numbers are used in the analysis of system stability through the Laplace transform and the transfer function.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: The state of quantum systems is often represented using complex vectors in Hilbert spaces.

### 8. **Complex Numbers in Geometry**

- Complex numbers can be represented geometrically on the **complex plane**, where the x-axis represents the real part and the y-axis represents the imaginary part.
- **Rotation and Scaling**: Multiplying a complex number by a real number scales it, and multiplying by a complex number in polar form corresponds to a rotation in the complex plane.

### 9. **Historical Background of Complex Numbers**

- The concept of complex numbers was first introduced in the 16th century by **Gerolamo Cardano** while solving cubic equations that did not have real solutions.
- **Rafael Bombelli** formalized the rules for operations with complex numbers in the 16th century.
- The term "imaginary" was coined by **René Descartes**, though it was initially used in a dismissive sense.
- In the 18th century, **Leonhard Euler** and **Carl Friedrich Gauss** contributed significantly to the development and acceptance of complex numbers, including their geometric interpretation.

### 10. **Visualization of Complex Functions**

- Complex functions, such as `f(z) = z^2` or `f(z) = e^z`, can be visualized using mappings on the complex plane.
- These mappings often involve transformations such as stretching, rotating, or inverting regions of the plane.
- Tools like **domain coloring** are used to represent the magnitude and argument of complex functions visually.

### 11. **Advanced Topics in Complex Numbers**

- **Analytic Functions**: Functions of a complex variable that are differentiable in a region of the complex plane are called analytic or holomorphic functions. These functions have profound implications in complex analysis.
- **Residue Theorem**: A powerful tool in evaluating complex integrals, particularly in physics and engineering.
- **Riemann Sphere**: A model that extends the complex plane to include a point at infinity, providing a compact representation of the complex numbers.
