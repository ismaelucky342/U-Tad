# Project 
This project has been carried out by dividing it into 3 libraries, 3 .c files for the utilities of the different structures and a main file, the program asks to enter and then display 3 users, 3 books and 3 orders on the screen through a macro constant and specific functions to create and display each type of structure.
As an addition, a basic Makefile has been developed for quick compilation of the project in testing.
