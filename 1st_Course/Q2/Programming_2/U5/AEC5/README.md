# File Handling Exercise in C

This C exercise covers various standard input and output functions for working with files, including reading, writing, and manipulating the file pointer. The program uses standard functions such as `fopen`, `fclose`, `fputs`, `fgetc`, `fgets`, `putc`, and others to perform file operations in a simple and efficient manner.

## Features

The program covers the following concepts:

1. **File Opening**:
    - Uses `fopen` to open a file in read/write mode.
2. **File Writing**:
    - Uses `fputs` to write strings.
    - Uses `putc` to write character by character.
3. **File Reading**:
    - Uses `fgetc` to read one character at a time.
    - Uses `fgets` to read a full line.
    - Uses `getc` to read character by character.
4. **Rewind and Feof**:
    - Uses `rewind` to reposition the file pointer to the beginning.
    - Uses `feof` to detect the end of a file.
5. **Content Printing**:
    - Uses `printf` to display the file's content.
6. **Error Handling**:
    - The program handles errors during file opening and reading.

## Required Files

The program requires a text file named `example.txt` that will be used for reading and writing operations. If the file does not exist, the program will create it automatically.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    
    If you haven't cloned the repository yet, you can do so by running the following command:
    
    ```bash
    git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
    cd <REPOSITORY_NAME>
    ```
    
2. **Compilation**:
    
    To compile the program, use the following command with `gcc` or your preferred compiler:
    
    ```bash
    gcc -o file_operations file_operations.c
    ```
    
3. **Execution**:
    
    Once compiled, you can run the program with the following command:
    
    ```bash
    ./file_operations
    ```
    
    The program will open, read, and write to the `example.txt` file, demonstrating the use of the mentioned functions.
    
4. **Expected Output**:
    
    The program will perform the following actions and display the output in the console:
    
    - Write text to the file using `fputs` and `putc`.
    - Read a character with `fgetc` and print it.
    - Read a line with `fgets` and print it.
    - Use `rewind` to reposition the file pointer and read the content from the beginning.
    - Display the complete file content using `printf`.
    - Read the file with `getc` and check for the end using `feof`.

## File Structure

The project contains the following files:

- **file_operations.c**: The main source code implementing file operations.
- **example.txt**: A sample text file where the program performs read and write operations.

## Possible Improvements

- **Binary File Handling**: Modify the program to handle binary files instead of text files.
- **User Input**: Enhance user interaction by allowing the program to accept the file name and text to write.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling, including custom exceptions or more detailed error messages.
